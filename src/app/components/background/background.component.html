            <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.upstatement.com/" target="_blank">Hello World Consulting LLC</a> building a workforce management solution for a time keeping company.
            I recently completed my Masters of Science in Computer Science at <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.fullerton.edu/" target="_blank">California State University, Fullerton</a>.
            My grandfather was an Electrical Engineer, my dad was an Electrical Engineer, so I followed their footsteps and completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.fullerton.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Irvine</a>.
            I worked in the Electrical Engineering field for 3 years before deciding to commit to a carreer change into Computer Science during Covid(Sorry Dad ðŸ˜…).
